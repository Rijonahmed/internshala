      <p>Property taxes are charged by local government entities, such as KMC, and are due by <br />
        the owner of the property. The amount of KMC property tax that must be paid may <br />
        vary. Thus, it depends on the location and a number of other criteria. KMC approved <br />
        the new Unit Area Assessment (UAA) mechanism for calculating property taxes in <br />
        March 2017.</p>
